D-Net - An affordable Secured Peer-to-Peer Networking Protocol Stack
Some years ago, employment path used to be determined by birth and education, often commiting to one employer until retirement. Today, you wouldn't  	even consider that as a viable option. Thanks to Internet, success is no longer solely determined by the right education, the perfect resume, or even your age, sex, background or country. Teens as young as 12 are now coding websites, producing films and building networks through social media. By the time they're adults, this online generation will already have the skills and real-world experience that a formal education just can't provide. The Internet Revolution brings access to any information combined with global supply and demand to shape established conventions and bringing old world definitions to end and bringing everyone and everything at just a click away. 

The Web 1.0 refers to the 1st stage of World Wide Web, which was entirely made up of web pages made up of hyperlinks and hardly some images which formed static websites that were not yet providing interactive content and were just source of information just like books in real-world.

The Web 2.0 brings an interactive and dynamic web experience focused on the ability for people to collaborate and share information online via social media, blogging and Web-based communities and brings a two-way conversation to enable anyone even without knowledge of computers to contribute and participate in anything he/she likes. 

	However, Web 2.0 seems to be broken as it also comes with it own limitations, some of which are
1. Centralization of Data in the hands of some big companies like Facebook, Google, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft which use user's data to gain User's addiction to their platform and sell ads.
2. Web 2.0 is based on Location-addressing as it works on Internet Protocols where everything is accessed by its IP Address which acts as an identifier and the data is prone to censorship or could be deleted or modified if the Company desires to.
3. No Enforced Personal Data Protection or Ownership Rules to protect the User's data from going into wrong hands which is leading to scandals like  Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal where Personal Data of Millions of FB Users was harvested to change the outcome of elections which may damage the politics of a country.

Moreover, as the Inventor of World Wide Web himself said the Web is Broken as is more and more becoming a place of misinformation, hate speech, scammers and trolls and need to be fixed.

	Some of the problems which we think we need to fix before its too late, are
1. Providing a safe place for humans to find the right places they want to look for and not some options which are only profitable for the big companies and crushes new local companies before they  become substantial which severely hurts the economy of a nation in serious ways.
2. Introduction of User-based models where anyone investing his time should be incentivized for his time invested on a platform instead of being served some addictive content and ads which are not relevant for him/her most of the time and eats up substantial time and causes serious social and health disorders and isn't even realized by most of the people. 
3. Introduction of a Universal Identity Systems where only user has all the control over his identity and can't be forged or seized by anyone.
4. Introduction of Personalized Online Assistants which are controlled and managed by the user himself and filters every information and only shows the results which are relevant for that particulare user. 

	If we look deeper into the Internet World we see some exciting technologies being developed which can fix the problems mentioned above and help humans move forward with immense speed unimaginable by our present generation of humanity or at least by most the people, some of which are
1. Machine Learning (ML)
2. Artificial Intelligence (AI)
3. Neural Networks
4. Robotics, Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR)
5. Blockchain
6. Digital Currencies 
7. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) 
8. Human Machine Interface (HMI)

	In order to build the Next Stage of Internet, we must have Open, Decentralized, Secure, Borderless Networks capable of running continously which can't be shut down by various Cyber attacks or some people who see them as a threat to their Present Business Models and are owned by the Users himself and not by any company which can change it to align with their profits and the data is owned by the user themselves.
	One of such promising Technologies is the Blockchain where the code and data is maintained by anyone who wishes to use the network and the identity is maintained by using Cryptographic Techniques which ensures no single entity stores sensitive information like usernames and passwords but are managed by only the user itself.

	The above networks not only provides the necessary infrastructure for a truly revolutionary networks but are also cheap to run as they can be run on individual Machines and the Database is shared across multiple computers which ensures no data is manipulated or deleted and can be accessed by anyone with high throughput.

	The above networks can be used to store all the events occuring on the network in a canonical format by putting the events/ transactions/ states into continously generated blocks which are timestamped and are linked to one-another using Cryptographic Algirithms like Hashing, Merkle Roots, etc. such that information once entered into blocks can't be changed later and the existence of any information can be verified by anyone at later time. Such networks are known as Blockchain Systems and are gaining lot of attention in recent years.  

What we aim to achieve?
An affordable Secured networking Solution which can be afforded by any organization and can be customized according to the needs of the organization to build Smart Self-Executing Applications which manage themselves as programmed and doesn't need large Human Resources to be developed, deployed and maintained to perform the operations of an organization.

Who can use this Sytem?
The system cam be used by any organization like a Bank, School, College, Hospital or any Digital Services provider using Internet to manage its data in whatever way it desires to.

What improvements does D-Net provides over traditional Internet Companies?
1. Full ownership of the organizations's data as everything from Development to maintaninance will be owned by the organization itself.
2. Implementation of Decentralized identities using the most advanced Crytpograhic Techniques such that no external provider like Google Authentication is required.
3. A multi-layered system where some nodes will be handling the Blockchain, while others can store the large files and other database and new nodes can be added as the network grows larger and larger. 
4. Use of Public-keys which acts as a username will be stored on the blockchain and also will provide Authorization and the use of Secret-keys which acts as the Password will be stored only on the Mobile Devices will be stored by the users themselves and every transaction/event will be signed by the user-itself which solves the problem of fake-identity and secures the system against most of the hacks or Cyber attacks.
5. All the data of a user will be encrypted with a secret-key and the data will be accessible only by the permissioned or Authorized users which removes the need for use of Complicated Authorization Codes which are controlled by external parties and can be compromised.
6. Full deployment of the system will be on Distributed Computers owned by the organization which eliminates the need for external parties called Host providers like Godaddy which charges huge amounts even for storing data on their servers.
7. Every user is able to connect to any node according to his needs as every node stores a table of all the IP Addresses known to be used by the system which eliminates the need for Domain providers like Google Domains or Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud Storage which again charges huge amounts even to provide a Domains.
